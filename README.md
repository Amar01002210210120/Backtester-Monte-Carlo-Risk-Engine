Event-driven backtester for intraday / LOB-style data. BACKTESTER will be used in conjuction with LOB research project, I chose Monte Carlo due to it's ability to process Quantitative processes.

## Layout
- `core/` core engine (data, strategy, portfolio)
- `examples/` runnable demos

## Run
```bash
python examples/intraday_demo.py
